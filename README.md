# unit-converter
Convert whatever ur heart desires

This is a generic conversion utility that will convert units when possible based on the conversion factors specified by a directed graph.

A direct path is not required, this utility will attempt to traverse the graph to find a valid conversion path, also, there's no need to worry about cycles in your graph.
